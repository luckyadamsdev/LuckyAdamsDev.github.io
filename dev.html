					<h3 class="commercial-header">Single Feather</h3>
					<p>
						A wholesome platformer about a duck and a scientist who don't get along. Encounter other animals, collect stars, and fight Dr. Agnes Shelly, all in an effort to save your babies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Single Feather supports up to nine players simultaneously, but can also be played alone. The game is still in development but has a free public demo. It contains a feature-rich level editor. The levels that players create can be shared with anyone in the world, regardless of whether they have bought a copy of Single Feather. All design, coding, sprite animation, and music was done independently. Made with Godot 3.6 and Godot Unit Test. Cloud Firestore is used as a database for telemetry data.

					<h3 class="commercial-header">Sea Birds: End of an Age</h3>
					<p>
						A minimalist, exploration game, based on the life of the pirate William Fly, whose death marked the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. Set sail on the high seas of a randomly generated world! Search both water and land for pieces of the treasure map, fighting anyone who stands in your way. Once you collect all four pieces you can uncover the treasure!
					</p>
					<p>
						Sea Birds: End of an Age was released in 2019, and was made in GameMaker Studio for Windows and Linux. This game was made almost completely solo, with the exception of the music, which was a joint effort by myself and Christopher Adams. It lead to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_VHrWZcg0A">my favourite YouTube video ever</a>, by Let's Game It Out.

						The game was developed entirely by myself, over 2 weeks,  from November 15th to 28th, 2025 for the class Design 1 in the Digital Media Design program at Red River College Polytechnic. The one exception is that the music was not made by me (sources available on the itch page). All sound effects used source audio clips from <a href="https://freesound.org">freesound.org</a>, which all used the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a> license and were modified to fit the context.
