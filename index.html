				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Lucky Adams, and I am a game developer, artist, animator, software developer, QA tester, and songwriter. I have 16 of years experience developing games and 4 years of experience working professionally in software development. I am an ambassador for the <a href="pegjam.com">Winnipeg Game Collective</a>. My first self-published game is called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/977310/Sea_Birds_End_of_an_Age/">Sea Birds: End of an Age</a>. It released on Steam in 2019. My current (and most ambitious) project is a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964930/Single_Feather/">Single Feather</a>.

			<h3>Career Goals</h3>
			<p>
				I'm working my way towards becoming a technical artist. I love all aspects of game development. I love the design, software development, art, animation, and beyond. In the years to come, I hope to being both my technical expertise and artistic skills to a professional work environment, where I make games that people love.
			</p>
			<p>
				My education is important to me. After I complete the Digital Media Design program, I plan to continue my education at Red River College Polytechnic and go through the 2-year Game Development (Art) program, and graduate from that in April 2028.
			</p>
			<p>
				Post-graduation, I hope to work at a game studio, the smaller the better. Ideally that would be in Winnipeg, but I would consider working remotely for a studio outside of Winnipeg. I have some experience freelancing and will consider doing that on the side.
