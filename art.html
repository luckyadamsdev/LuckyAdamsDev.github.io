					This is a cutscene that introduces Dr. Agnes Shelley, before the first boss level in Single Feather. I animated this in Procreate.
				</p>
				<p>
					This introduces the core conflict of the story, both the duck and Dr. Shelley want the eggs, for different reasons. The tone is light, welcoming, and cute.
				</p>
				<p>
					My first (left) and second (right) drafts of this animation are below.

					This duck is the protagonist of Single Feather. His spirit is carefree, silly, and cute.
				</p>
				<p>
					His walk cycle is intentionally very different from how a real duck walks. It's a mix between a chicken's and a human's walk. An early problem was that the duck was moving across the screen much faster than his feet were carrying him. I solved that by adding bounce to the animation, keeping him in the air for most of his walk cycle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Krita was used to create the sprite sheets and the AnimationPlayer in Godot 3.6 was used to time and animate each frame.

					My vision for this character is of a '90s urban hooligan.
				</p>
				<p>
					I chose to base the player character on my Design instructor, Chris Pointon. He, to be clear, is no hooligan, but he does have a love for 90s hip-hop, so I used that for inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>
					The character is composed of three pieces: a skateboard, legs, and upper body. Each piece can be moved independently, yet they work together. Procreate was used to draw each frame and the AnimationPlayer in Godot 3.6 was used to animate the character.

					Dr. Agnes Shelley, the 2D, pixelated antagonist from Single Feather, is rendered here in 3D. Made in ZBrush.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lighting and posing portray her as energetic, determined, and furious. The posing was based on the 2D art below on the left.
				</p>
				<p>
					An untextured work-in-progress version is shown below on the right. I constructed the basic shapes of the figure first, sculpted them, and then merged them together.

						Springtime, midday, near the Northwestern coast of Turtle Island. The wind is gentle, the air is fresh, and the sun is warm. You are surrounded by a thick forest and a vast mountain range.

						This is a screenshot of Single Feather. The scene combines pixel art with painterly textures made of brush strokes. The colours are vibrant, with a cool dominant background and a warmer foreground.
