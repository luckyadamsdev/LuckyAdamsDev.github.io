					This is a cutscene that introduces Dr. Agnes Shelley, before the first boss level in Single Feather. I animated this in Procreate.
				</p>
				<p>
					This introduces the core conflict of the story, both the duck and Dr. Shelley want the eggs, for different reasons. The tone is light, welcoming, and cute.
				</p>
				<p>
					My first (left) and second (right) drafts of this animation are below.

					This duck is the protagonist of Single Feather. His spirit is carefree, silly, and cute.
				</p>
				<p>
					His walk cycle is intentionally very different from how a real duck walks. It's a mix between a chicken's and a human's walk. An early problem was that the duck was moving across the screen much faster than his feet were carrying him. I solved that by adding bounce to the animation, keeping him in the air for most of his walk cycle.

				<p>
					Krita was used to create the sprite sheets and the AnimationPlayer in Godot 3.6 was used to time and animate each frame.

					My vision for this character is of a '90s urban hooligan.
				</p>
				<p>
					I chose to base the player character on my Design instructor, Chris Pointon. He, to be clear, is no hooligan, but he does have a love for 90s hip-hop, so I used that for inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>
					The character is composed of three pieces: a skateboard, legs, and upper body. Each piece can be moved independently, yet they work together. Procreate was used to draw each frame and the AnimationPlayer in Godot 3.6 was used to animate the character.
