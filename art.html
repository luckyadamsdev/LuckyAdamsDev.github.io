						This is a cutscene that introduces Dr. Agnes Shelley, before the first boss level in Single Feather. I animated this in Procreate.
					</p>
					<p>
						This introduces the core conflict of the story: Both the duck and Dr. Shelley want the eggs, but for different reasons. The tone is light, welcoming, and cute.
					</p>
					<p>
						My first (left) and second (right) drafts of this animation are below.

					This duck is the protagonist of Single Feather. His spirit is carefree, silly, and cute.
				</p>
				<p>
					An early problem was that the duck was moving across the screen much faster than his feet were carrying him. This was my dilemma: I didn't want to slow down his movement to match his feet, I didn't want his legs to move super fast to match his movement, and I didn't want his feet to slide on the ground. I solved this by adding bounce to the animation, keeping him in the air for most of his walk cycle.
				</p>
				<p>
					His walk cycle is intentionally very different from how a real duck walks. It's a mix between a chicken's and a human's walk.
				</p>
				<p>
					Krita was used to create the sprite sheets and the AnimationPlayer in Godot 3.6 was used to time and animate each frame.

					My vision for this character is of a '90s urban hooligan.
				</p>
				<p>
					I chose to base the player character on my Design instructor, Chris Pointon. He, to be clear, is no hooligan, but he does have a love for 90s hip-hop, so I used that for inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>
					The character is composed of three pieces: a skateboard, legs, and upper body. Each piece can be moved independently, yet they work together. Procreate was used to draw each frame and the AnimationPlayer in Godot 3.6 was used to animate the character.

					Dr. Agnes Shelley, the 2D, pixelated antagonist from Single Feather, is rendered here in 3D. Made in ZBrush.

					The lighting and posing portray her as energetic, determined, and furious. The posing was based on the 2D art below on the left.

					An untextured work-in-progress version is shown below on the right. I constructed the basic shapes of the figure first, sculpted them, and then merged them together.

						This is a screenshot of Single Feather. The scene combines pixel art with painterly textures made of brush strokes. The colours are vibrant, with a cool dominant background and a warmer foreground.

							This is a concept for a horror movie poster, based on the King of the Hill episode “Pigmalion”, from season seven. While it is one of my favourite episodes, it is also polarizing. Some find it too dark and disturbing, as it is unlike any other episode of King of the Hill.
						</p>
						<p>
							An unnatural pink colour at the bottom of the poster fades into a desaturated pink, symbolizing decay.
						</p>
						<p>
							Peggy, screaming in the foreground, looks down at the body of a body of a headless dead pig. That leads viewers' eyes down further to the title “Pigmalion.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Trim Larson, the man in the centre, is the antagonist. He comes between Peggy and Luanne, in this episode, and that is reflected in the design of the poster.
						</p>
						<p>
							I took screenshots from the episode and then traced over them in Procreate to create a higher resolution version of each character. Those assets were brought into Adobe Illustrator, where I composed all the other elements, including the text.
